This project is built with Illumination Software Creator.  Below are a few items worth noting that cover how to run and test your Android application.

1) You must have a functioning copy of Eclipse and the Android SDK installed.  You can download them, and find full instructions on setting them up for Windows, Linux or MacOS X from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html.

2) Now that your project is built with Illumination, open up Eclipse and go to the File menu, select Import, and choose General -> Existing Projects Into Workspace.  Then select the root directory of your new Android project and click Finish.  This will add your project into Eclipse.

3) By default your project is set to use the Android SDK version 2.2.  If you have this installed you are all set.  If not, you can either follow the instructions on the URL in step 1 to install version 2.2, or you can right click on your project name on the right hand side of Eclipse, choose Properties, and choose a different SDK version from the Android section.

4) At this point your project is all set and ready to run!  Simply choose Run from the Run menu and select Android Application (only necessary the first time you run this project) and the Android Simulator will launch and load your application!
